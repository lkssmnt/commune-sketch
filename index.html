            Commune, Part I: Conversations pairs thinkers and makers from disparate disciplines to discuss emergent ideas of community within an increasingly hybrid IRL/online world. The series focuses on the structures and protocols of diverse gatherings and communal groups, emphasizing the visible and invisible power dynamics that serve to organize them. Each event includes two invited guests, in conversation for the first time, moderated by curator and designer Prem Krishnamurthy. These events take place on Wednesdays throughout June 2020 on a custom Jitsi “stage” that plays with the architecture and display of virtual social interactions.
